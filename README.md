# data-structures-and-algorithm-project
1. Define two abstract data structures, one in the AVL tree and the other in the stack (both data structures will be programmed in the linked list logic) and do the basic operations programs? In each node of the AVL tree, the student's number, name, surname and department information will be kept and indexing will be done according to the surname of the student. In each node of the stack, the student's number, name, surname and department information will be kept and indexing will be done according to the student number.
2. Using the AVL tree you have designed, the class list of the Database Management Systems course will be kept and the class list of the Data Structures and Algorithms course will be kept in the stack. The program you will write will contain the basic operations of the AVL tree and the stack, and in addition the following functions will be requested. Create a menu that contains the basic operations in the main program and can be used to achieve the following:
a. List the students who take both courses more than once?
b. List only the students taking the Database Management Systems course? (These students will not be taking Data Structures and Algorithms course.)
c. Both courses will be divided into A and B groups.
I. Students who take Database Management Systems course will be divided into groups according to their numbers. In group A there will be odd numbers and in group B there will be odd numbers.
ii. Students who take Data Structures and Algorithms course will be divided into groups according to their surnames. Group A will include students whose name starts with letters in the A-K range. In group B, students whose name starts with letters in the L-Z range will take place.
D. List the students who have taken both courses and have other departmental students. (There may be different departmental students who take minor and double major courses in the courses.)
Data Structures and Algorithms and Database Management Systems courses will not change as a result of the above operations. These lists should be available on request.
3. Do the following for your program?
a. Using the selective sorting algorithm, list only the students taking the Database Management Systems course by name?
b. Sort the Data Structures and Algorithms course by number using the fast sorting algorithm?
